# Welcome to my GitHub!

I’m **18 years old** and currently studying programming at a technical school, specializing in software development. I mostly learn programming through **ChatGPT** (yeah, I know it’s not the best way) and the endless resources on the internet.

## My Philosophy

For me, coding isn’t just about writing lines of code – it’s about **creativity**, **problem-solving**, and **continuous learning**.
